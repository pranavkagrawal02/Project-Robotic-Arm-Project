# Project-Robotic-Arm-Project

Objective : To pick an object from source and drop at right angle from the source location.



Poject Learning objectives :=

1. Assemble all the components of the robotic arm which includes a base, sticks, h bridge (shield or breadboard), Arduino, creative hands(form of paper/cardboard),8 core rainbow wire strips, 9v battery.

2. Making required wired Connection through 8 core rainbow wire strips should be performed with the help of soldering.

3. Perform the 2D and 3D (up, down and rotation) movements of the arm without Arduino. 

4. To study the introduction to Arduino and implement basic programs such as Clockwise/Anticlockwise motion of motor with the help of Arduino.

5. Perform the 2D and 3D (up, down and rotation) anticlockwise and clockwise movements of the arm with Arduino.
